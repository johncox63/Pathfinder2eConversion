## Arcane Synergist ((+Arcane Synergist))
Through hard study, arcane casters from certain wizard's circles in Khorvaire have learned to meld arcane magic and with magic from another secondary tradition, and each circle specializes in one particular secondary tradition. Also note, that the term "wizard's circle is a bit a misnomer - while wizards certainly comprise the vast majority of the membership within each circle, anyone who can cast spells from the arcane tradition is generally welcomed, primarily certain sorcerers and witches. Examples of the secondary tradition of certain major circles are:
* The Arcane Order of Aureon - Divine
* The Gilded Labyrinth - Divine
* The Guild of Moonlight and Whispers - Primal
* The Guild of Starlight and Shadows - Primal
* The Unspoken Word - Occult
* The Closed Circle - Occult

info (
#### Synergistic Spells
Synergistic spells are spells drawn from the secondary tradition of a circle's spell list, though you cast them as arcane spells. You don’t gain new synergistic spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new synergistic spells and new spell levels of synergistic spells only through feats. Synergistic spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your arcane class; for example, a wizard who gained synergistic spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire.

Each time you cast a synergistic spell, it is an arcane spell. You can’t heighten a synergistic spell beyond your maximum spell level of synergistic spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a synergistic spell as a signature spell.

Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a synergistic feat, you can swap out one of your old synergistic spells for a different synergistic spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out synergistic spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a synergistic spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.

still wear it as an insignia, you can detach it to grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this is a miniature form of the animal the insignia incorporates. Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in insignia form, the familiar can move around on its jewelry and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple insignia unless the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. 

Your insignia familiar has access to the cloak insignia familiar ability.

**Cloak Insignia** When in insignia form, your familiar can hide its obvious supernatural qualities to pass as a simple insignia. It doesn’t need to Impersonate to fool a passing glance, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Deception DC against an active observer Seeking or otherwise studying it.

info(
#### Arcane Circle Insignia

When a wizard circle admits an individual as a member, they are granted the right to wear the insignia of the order. These typically take the form of broaches, pendants or rings, or perhaps the ornated topper to a staff or rod, depending on the circle. By broad tradition on Khorvaire, these insignia may be personalized relatively expansively by the individual member, with each member's personalized insignia also becoming an abstract representation of the outward magic that the member chooses to focus on, the internal magic that is an intrinsic part of the member, and the member’s true spiritual essance. These insignia almost always incorporate the form of an animal specific to the order.

## Scholar of the Prophecy ((+Scholar of the Prophecy))
The Draconic Prophecy is as complex and unfathomable as the dragons themselves. A few among the lesser races learn and study snippets of the huge and constantly accumulating text, but only the dragons have the time and perspective to see the Prophecy for what it truly is. There are few traditional texts containing parts of the Prophecy. Instead, those that have delved into the mysteries of the Draconic Prophecy believe that the universe itself, in particular, The Rings of Siberys, is a living text that carries and reveals passages of the Prophecy to those who can see it.

If you have a hand free and you've gazed at the night sky in the last 24 hours, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence.

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your Occultism DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being flat-footed, even though you wouldn't take the –2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
